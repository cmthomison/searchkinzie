Logic for dealing with items 1 and 3:

It most likely makes sense to rewrite the code.

[new] Terms options:
Sale
Lease
Sale or Lease (meaning both options exist for one property)
All (query all properties in this category (essentially don't query this field)- have this be the default selection so there will be no -Select- option)

[new] Type options:
City-owned property
Neighborhood listing
All (query all properties in this category (essentially don't query this field)- have this be the default selection so there will be no -Select- option)

if Terms = Sale, Lease, or Sale or Lease, AND Type = City-owned property or Neighborhood listing,
then perform existing query

else if Terms = All, AND Type = City-owned property or Neighborhood listing,
then query = where "SF >= '" + selSfLow + "' AND SF <= '" + selSfHigh + "' AND type = '" + selType + "'"

else if Terms = Sale, Lease, or Sale or Lease, AND Type = All,
then query = where "terms = '" + selTerms + "' AND SF >= '" + selSfLow + "' AND SF <= '" + selSfHigh + "'"

else if Terms = All, AND Type = All,
then query = where "SF >= '" + selSfLow + "' AND SF <= '" + selSfHigh + "'"



These variables will need to be constructed outside the qLayer function so that a clearLayer function can tLayer.setMap(null);

On click of query, first clearLayer(), then qLayer().

Sale -> Everything but lease
Lease -> Everything but sale
All -->
