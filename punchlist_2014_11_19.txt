3.) PROBLEM: Sale/Lease/Either
From Ben's email:
"All properties should be arranged into one of three categories: “Sale”, “Lease”, or “Either”.  It looks like we can denote this under the “terms” column in the Fusion Table.  The Search Criteria pull-down bar should likewise read “Sale”, “Lease”, or “Either”.  Selecting “Sale” should return all rows listed as “Sale” or “Either”.  Selecting “Lease” should return all rows listed as “Lease” or “Either”.  Selecting “Either” should return all rows."
ISSUE: "Either" should not necessarily return all rows- BECAUSE the properties that are labeled "Either" are available for SALE AND/OR LEASE.
AT THIS POINT: Discuss with Ben on Thursday on how to handle this.
POTENTIAL SOLUTION: Sale/Lease/Either/All
